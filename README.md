9. Open the notebook. Add the credentials of your Watson Machine Learning service in **4.1**.

``` 
   wml_credentials = {
     "apikey": "***",
     "iam_apikey_description": "Auto-generated for key ***",
     "iam_apikey_name": "Service credentials-1",
     "iam_role_crn": "crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::serviceRole:Writer",
     "iam_serviceid_crn": "crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam-identity::a/***",
     "instance_id": "***",
     "url": "https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com"
   }
   
   
``` 

10. Run all the cells in the notebook to create the model. Test your model with the Pixie App at the end of the notebook. 

    Voil√†! You're done creating your own AI recommendation engine!!
